# Perl - Short Introduction

This page is a comprehensive guide to **Perl Scripting** with some applied samples related to cloud programming. 

Certainly! Here's a comprehensive introduction to Perl programming for beginners:

## **What is Perl**

Perl is a versatile and powerful scripting language known for its text manipulation capabilities and its use in system administration, web development, and more. It emphasizes practicality and ease of use.

**Getting Started: Running Perl Code**
1. Check if Perl is installed on your system by running `perl -v` in the terminal.
2. Open a text editor and create a new file with a `.pl` extension, e.g., `myscript.pl`.
3. Write your Perl code in the script file.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your script.
5. Run the script: `perl myscript.pl`.

## **Basic Concepts**

- **Print:** Display output using `print` function.
  ```bash
  print "Hello, World!\n";
  ```

> **Variables**

- Perl uses sigils to indicate variable types: `$` for scalars, `@` for arrays, and `%` for hashes.
  ```bash
  $name = "John";
  @fruits = ("apple", "banana", "orange");
  %person = ("name", "Alice", "age", 30);
  ```

> **Scalar Data Types**

- **Strings:** Enclosed in single or double quotes.
- **Numbers:** Integers and floating-point numbers.
- **Booleans:** Represented as `1` for true and `0` for false.

**Arrays:**
- Ordered collections of scalars.
```bash
@numbers = (1, 2, 3);
print "Second number: $numbers[1]\n";
```

> **Hashes**

- Key-value pairs.
```bash
%person = ("name", "Bob", "age", 25);
print "Name: $person{'name'}\n";
```

> **Conditional Statements**

Use `if`, `elsif`, and `else` for conditional execution.
```bash
if ($age < 18) {
    print "You're a minor.\n";
} else {
    print "You're an adult.\n";
}
```

> **Loops**

- **`for` Loop:** Iterate over a list.
```bash
@fruits = ("apple", "banana", "orange");
foreach $fruit (@fruits) {
    print "I like $fruit.\n";
}
```

> **Functions**

Define and use subroutines to encapsulate code.
```bash
sub greet {
    my ($name) = @_;
    print "Hello, $name!\n";
}
greet("Eve");
```

## **Scripting**

- Create a new file with a `.pl` extension, e.g., `myscript.pl`.
- Write your Perl code in the script file.

**Running Scripts:**
1. Make the script executable: `chmod +x myscript.pl`.
2. Run the script: `./myscript.pl`.


## **Examples**

1. **Hello World:**
   ```bash
   print "Hello, World!\n";
   ```

2. **Simple Calculator:**
   ```bash
   print "Enter first number: ";
   $num1 = <STDIN>;
   print "Enter second number: ";
   $num2 = <STDIN>;
   $sum = $num1 + $num2;
   print "Sum: $sum\n";
   ```

3. **File Backup Script:**
   ```bash
   use File::Copy;
   $source_dir = "/path/to/source";
   $backup_dir = "/path/to/backup";
   $timestamp = `date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`;
   $backup_file = "backup_$timestamp.tar.gz";
   copy("$source_dir", "$backup_dir/$backup_file");
   print "Backup saved as $backup_file\n";
   ```

<br />

`Perl` is known for its text processing and regular expression capabilities, making it a popular choice for tasks like log parsing, text manipulation, and automation. 
As you continue learning `Perl`, you can explore more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, modules, and interacting with external libraries.

# Python - Short Introduction

This page is a comprehensive guide to **Python Scripting** with some applied samples related to cloud programming. 

## **What is Python**

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity. 
It's widely used for various applications, including web development, data analysis, scientific computing, automation, and more.

**Getting Started: Running Python Code**
1. Install Python: Download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Type `python` or `python3` (depending on your system) to start the Python interpreter.
4. You'll see the Python prompt (`>>>`) where you can type and run Python code.

## **Basic Concepts**

- **Variables:** Store data using variables.
  ```python
  name = "John"
  age = 25
  ```
- **Print:** Display output using `print()` function.
  ```python
  print("Hello, " + name)
  ```

**Data Types:**
- **Strings:** Text data enclosed in quotes (`'` or `"`).
- **Numbers:** Integers and floating-point numbers.
- **Lists:** Ordered collections of items.
- **Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs.
- **Booleans:** `True` or `False` values.

**Conditional Statements:**
Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` for conditional execution.
```python
if age < 18:
    print("You're a minor.")
else:
    print("You're an adult.")
```

**Loops:**
- **`for` Loop:** Iterate over a sequence.
  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
  for fruit in fruits:
      print("I like", fruit)
  ```
- **`while` Loop:** Execute code while a condition is true.
  ```python
  count = 1
  while count <= 5:
      print("Count:", count)
      count += 1
  ```

**Functions:**
Define and use functions to encapsulate code.
```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name + "!")
greet("Alice")
```

## **Scripting**

- Create a new file with a `.py` extension, e.g., `myscript.py`.
- Write your Python code in the script file.

**Running Scripts:**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing your script.
3. Run the script: `python myscript.py` or `python3 myscript.py`.

## **Examples**

1. **Hello World:**
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

2. **Simple Calculator:**
   ```python
   num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
   num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
   sum = num1 + num2
   print("Sum:", sum)
   ```

3. **File Backup Script:**
   ```python
   import shutil
   import os
   source_dir = "/path/to/source"
   backup_dir = "/path/to/backup"
   timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
   backup_file = f"backup_{timestamp}.tar.gz"
   shutil.make_archive(os.path.join(backup_dir, backup_file), "gztar", source_dir)
   print(f"Backup saved as {backup_file}")
   ```

<br />

As you progress in `Python`, you can explore more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, file handling, libraries, frameworks, and more. 
Python's extensive community and rich ecosystem of libraries make it a fantastic language to learn and apply to a wide range of projects.

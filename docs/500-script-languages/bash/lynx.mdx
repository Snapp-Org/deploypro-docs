# Lynx

`lynx` is a text-based web browser that allows users to browse the internet and view web pages from the command line in Unix-like operating systems. 
It's a versatile tool for accessing information from websites without requiring a graphical user interface. 
While it doesn't render images or complex layouts like modern graphical browsers, it's useful for quick access to text-based content, checking links, and accessing web resources in a terminal environment.

## **Basic Usage**

```
lynx [options] [URL]
```

## **Common Options**

- `-accept_all_cookies`: Automatically accept all cookies.
- `-cookies`: Enable cookie support.
- `-force_html`: Treat non-HTML files as HTML.
- `-nolist`: Disable display of HTML lists.
- `-dump`: Output page content as plain text.
- `-source`: View page source.
- `-bookmark`: Create bookmarks.
- `-auth`: Provide HTTP authentication credentials.
- `-help` or `--help`: Display help information.

## **Examples**

1. **Viewing a Web Page:**
   ```bash
   lynx https://www.example.com
   ```
   This opens the `example.com` website in `lynx`.

2. **Viewing Page Source:**
   ```bash
   lynx -source https://www.example.com
   ```
   This displays the HTML source code of the `example.com` website.

3. **Browsing with Navigation:**
   - Use arrow keys to navigate.
   - Press `Enter` to follow links.
   - Press `Q` to quit `lynx`.

4. **Viewing Plain Text Version:**
   ```bash
   lynx -dump https://www.example.com
   ```
   This outputs the text-based content of the `example.com` website.

5. **Creating Bookmarks:**
   ```bash
   lynx -bookmark https://www.example.com
   ```
   This opens the `example.com` website and allows you to add a bookmark.

6. **Accepting All Cookies:**
   ```bash
   lynx -accept_all_cookies https://www.example.com
   ```
   This opens the website and automatically accepts all cookies.

## **Advanced Usage**

- `lynx` supports navigation through forms, submitting data, viewing images with external viewers, and more.
- `lynx.cfg` is the configuration file that controls `lynx` behavior. It can be customized to alter settings.

## **Use Cases**

- Quick access to text-based content without a graphical browser.
- Checking website links for validity.
- Reading articles or documentation from the command line.
- Accessing web resources on servers without GUI interfaces.

## **Limitations**

- `lynx` doesn't render modern web page layouts, CSS styles, or JavaScript functionality.
- It's most effective for browsing text-heavy websites.

## **Conclusion**

`lynx` is particularly useful for users who prefer the command line or those working on remote servers. 
While it lacks the visual sophistication of graphical browsers, it's a lightweight and efficient way to access information from the web.

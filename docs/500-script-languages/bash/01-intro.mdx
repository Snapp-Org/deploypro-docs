# Bash - Short Introduction

This page is a comprehensive guide to **Bash Scripting** with some applied samples related to cloud programming. 
We'll cover the basics of Bash scripting, and then provide examples of how Bash can be used in cloud programming scenarios.

## **What is Bash?**

Bash, short for "Bourne Again Shell," is a command-line interface and scripting language used in Unix-like operating systems. 
It provides a way to interact with the operating system by running commands, and it also supports writing scripts to automate tasks.

## **Getting Started**

1. Open a terminal on your system. This is where you'll interact with Bash.
2. Type a command and press Enter to execute it. For example, `ls` lists files in the current directory.
3. Arguments can be added after the command, like `ls -l` to list files in long format.

> **Basic Commands:**

- `ls`: List files and directories in the current location.
- `cd`: Change directory.
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory.
- `touch`: Create an empty file.
- `cp`: Copy files or directories.
- `mv`: Move or rename files or directories.
- `rm`: Remove files or directories (use with caution).

## **Variables**

Bash uses variables to store and manipulate data.

```bash
name="John"
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

> **Input and Output:**

- `echo`: Print text to the screen.
- `read`: Read input from the user.

```bash
echo "What's your name?"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

> **Conditional Statements:**

Bash supports `if` statements for conditional execution.

```bash
age=25
if [ "$age" -lt 18 ]; then
    echo "You're a minor."
else
    echo "You're an adult."
fi
```

> **Loops:**

- `for`: Iterate over a list of values.
```bash
for fruit in apple banana orange; do
    echo "I like $fruit."
done
```
- `while`: Execute commands while a condition is true.
```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $count"
    ((count++))
done
```

## **Functions**

Define and use functions to encapsulate code.
```bash
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}
greet "Alice"
```

## **Scripting**

- Create a new file with `.sh` extension, e.g., `myscript.sh`.
- Add the shebang line `#!/bin/bash` at the top to specify the interpreter.
- Write your Bash commands in the script file.

> **Running Scripts:**

1. Make the script executable: `chmod +x myscript.sh`.
2. Run the script: `./myscript.sh`.

> **Examples:**

1. **Hello World:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello, World!"
   ```

2. **Simple Calculator:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   read -p "Enter first number: " num1
   read -p "Enter second number: " num2
   sum=$((num1 + num2))
   echo "Sum: $sum"
   ```

3. **File Backup Script:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   source_dir="/path/to/source"
   backup_dir="/path/to/backup"
   timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
   backup_file="backup_$timestamp.tar.gz"
   tar -czvf "$backup_dir/$backup_file" "$source_dir"
   echo "Backup saved as $backup_file"
   ```

## Applied Samples in `Cloud Programming`

> **Automation and Scripted Provisioning:**

- Use Bash scripts to automate the creation of virtual machines, storage resources, and networking components on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

> **Deploying Applications:**

- Bash scripts can automate the deployment of applications to cloud environments. For example, deploying a web application to a virtual machine using `scp` (secure copy) and then starting it.

> **Managing Infrastructure as Code:**

- Use Bash to write scripts that interact with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or CloudFormation. For example, you can use Bash to apply or destroy infrastructure configurations.

> **Interacting with Cloud APIs:**

- Bash scripts can interact with cloud provider APIs using tools like `curl` to manage resources, list instances, or trigger actions programmatically.

> **Backup and Restore:**

- Bash scripts can automate backup and restore operations for cloud-based databases, files, and other resources.

> **Log Retrieval and Analysis:**

- Use Bash scripts to retrieve logs and perform basic analysis to identify issues in cloud-based applications.

> **Monitoring and Alerts:**

- Bash scripts can run scheduled tasks to monitor cloud resources and send alerts or notifications if certain conditions are met.

> **Container Operations:**

- Bash scripts can be used to automate container operations, such as building and deploying Docker images in a cloud environment.

> **Cleaning Up Resources:**

- Bash scripts can help automate resource cleanup after tests or deployments, ensuring you don't incur unnecessary costs.

<br />

Remember that this is just a basic introduction to `Bash` scripting. 
As you become more comfortable with `Bash`, you can explore more advanced topics like string manipulation, arrays, error handling, and integration with other tools and languages.

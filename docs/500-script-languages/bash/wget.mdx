# Wget

`wget` is a command-line utility used for downloading files from the internet. 
It supports various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and FTPS. `wget` is commonly used to retrieve files and web content from the command line in Unix-like operating systems.

## **Basic Syntax**

```
wget [options] [URL]
```

## **Common Options**

- `-O` or `--output-document`: Specify the output file name.
- `-P` or `--directory-prefix`: Specify the directory to save the downloaded file.
- `-r` or `--recursive`: Download recursively (follow links).
- `-N` or `--timestamping`: Download only newer files.
- `-c` or `--continue`: Resume a partially downloaded file.
- `-q` or `--quiet`: Quiet mode (suppress output).
- `-U` or `--user-agent`: Set the user agent string.
- `-h` or `--help`: Display help information.

## **Examples**

1. **Downloading a File:**
   ```bash
   wget https://www.example.com/file.txt
   ```
   This downloads `file.txt` from `example.com`.

2. **Downloading with Custom Output Name:**
   ```bash
   wget -O output.txt https://www.example.com/file.txt
   ```
   This downloads `file.txt` from `example.com` and saves it as `output.txt`.

3. **Downloading to a Specific Directory:**
   ```bash
   wget -P /path/to/directory https://www.example.com/file.txt
   ```
   This downloads `file.txt` to the specified directory.

4. **Recursively Downloading a Website:**
   ```bash
   wget -r https://www.example.com
   ```
   This downloads the entire `example.com` website and its linked content.

5. **Resuming a Partial Download:**
   ```bash
   wget -c https://www.example.com/largefile.zip
   ```
   This resumes downloading `largefile.zip` if it was interrupted or partially downloaded.

6. **Downloading Only Newer Files:**
   ```bash
   wget -N https://www.example.com/updates.tar.gz
   ```
   This downloads `updates.tar.gz` only if it's newer than the existing local copy.

## **Advanced Usage**

## **Use Cases**

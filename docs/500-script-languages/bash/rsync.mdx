# Rsync 

Using the `rsync` command in `Bash`, you can synchronize the contents of a directory between two locations, either locally or across different machines over a network. Here's the basic syntax and some examples:

> **Synta**

```bash
rsync [options] source_directory destination
```

> **Examples**

1. **Local Sync:**

   To synchronize a directory named "source" to a directory named "destination" locally:

   ```bash
   rsync -av source/ destination/
   ```

   - `-a`: Archive mode, preserving file permissions, ownership, timestamps, etc.
   - `-v`: Verbose mode, showing details of the synchronization process.

2. **Remote Sync:**

   To synchronize a local directory to a remote machine over SSH:

   ```bash
   rsync -av source/ user@remote_host:destination/
   ```

   - Replace `user` with the remote machine's username.
   - Replace `remote_host` with the IP address or hostname of the remote machine.
   - Ensure you have SSH access to the remote machine and the necessary permissions.

3. **Excluding Files:**

   You can exclude specific files or patterns using the `--exclude` option. For example, excluding all `.txt` files:

   ```bash
   rsync -av --exclude '*.txt' source/ destination/
   ```

4. **Progress Information:**

   To see progress information during synchronization, you can use the `--progress` option:

   ```bash
   rsync -av --progress source/ destination/
   ```

5. **Dry Run (Preview):**

   To see what changes would be made without actually executing the synchronization, use the `--dry-run` option:

   ```bash
   rsync -av --dry-run source/ destination/
   ```

6. **Deleting Extraneous Files:**

   By default, `rsync` does not delete files in the destination that are not in the source. To delete extraneous files in the destination, use the `--delete` option:

   ```bash
   rsync -av --delete source/ destination/
   ```

<br />

These examples cover some of the common use cases for `rsync`. The command offers many more options and functionalities for more complex synchronization scenarios. 
Always refer to the `rsync` documentation (`man rsync`) for a complete list of options and their explanations.

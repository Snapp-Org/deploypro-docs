# Essential Linux tools

Linux is a free and open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for numerous operating systems, commonly referred to as "Linux distributions" or "Linux distros." 
The kernel itself was initially created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and has since been developed collaboratively by a global community of programmers.

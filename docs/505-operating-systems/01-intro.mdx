# Operating Systems

An operating system (OS) is a software program that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and software applications. 
It provides a set of essential services and functionalities that enable users and applications to interact with and utilize the underlying hardware resources of a computer system. 

## âœ… Features of an operating system

### **Resource Management** 

The operating system manages and allocates system resources such as CPU time, memory, disk space, and input/output devices among different applications and processes.

### **Process Management** 

The OS controls the execution of processes (individual programs or tasks) by scheduling them, switching between them, and providing mechanisms for inter-process communication and synchronization.

### **Memory Management** 

It oversees the allocation and utilization of system memory (RAM) to various programs and processes, ensuring efficient use and preventing conflicts.

### **File System Management** 

The OS provides a hierarchical structure for organizing and storing files on storage devices, managing file access, permissions, and providing file-related services.

### **Device Management** 

It manages communication and interaction with hardware devices such as printers, disks, network interfaces, and more.

### **User Interface** 

The operating system provides a user interface that allows users to interact with the computer, whether through command-line interfaces, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), or other methods.

### **Security and Access Control**

It enforces security measures, controls user access to resources, and protects against unauthorized access and malicious activities.

### **Networking** 

For systems connected to networks, the OS facilitates network communication, including protocols, configuration, and data transfer.

### **Error Handling** 

The OS handles errors and exceptions that can occur during system operation, preventing crashes and providing mechanisms for graceful recovery.

<br />

Different types of operating systems exist for various computing environments, such as personal computers, servers, embedded systems, mobile devices, and more. 
Examples include Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS.

The operating system plays a crucial role in managing the overall functionality and performance of a computer system while providing a user-friendly interface for interaction.

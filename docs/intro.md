## ‚úÖ Full Sample for AWS

In this demonstration, we will use an open-source sample generated by **Rocket Generator**, a free service that [Generates Django Starters](https://app-generator.dev/).

> [Django Soft Dashboard](https://github.com/app-generator/sample-rocket-django-aws) - `open-source` starter

### Here are the steps

- Access [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/) and register using `GitHub`
- Connect your **AWS** account
- Create a new VPS Server and wait the full deployment 
- Create a new app or simply fork this sample:
  - https://github.com/app-generator/sample-rocket-django-aws
- Complete the deployment form
- Confirm the deployment 
- Access the GitHub repository and monitor the progress (GitHub Actions)
- Visit the app in the browser. 

<br />

### Access [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/)

The service allows the registration using GitHub (no password required)

![DeployPRO - Registration Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51854817/263670395-cf095113-c0b1-44ab-91ef-1ca4fc871ead.jpg)
 
<br />

### Connect AWS 

In the `connections` page, users can connect to AWS via credentials. 

![DeployPRO - AWS Credentials](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51854817/263670354-2b1dd20b-4874-49f7-a97a-44f8703bb27d.jpg)

If the operation is successfull, the connection to AWS is falled as active.

<br />

### Create new Server 

Before deploying the project, a deployment server needs to be created. This operation takes aprox. 5 minutes. 

![DeployPRO - Create AWS Server](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51854817/263670373-dd12a0da-48b9-4954-8440-3768bdd97083.jpg)

<br />

Once created, we can access the default page and also check out the details in our AWS account:

<br />

<br />

The server state can be also checked on DeployPRO.

<br />

### Deploy `Django`

In this phase, the user needs to provide:

- the repository 
- app name 
- path to the `Dockerfile` 
- the PORT exposed in Docker (execution entry point)
- the `DeployPRO` subdomain 

![DeployPRO - AWS & Django, App information](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51854817/263670396-d5a7f163-e637-4289-a7a2-2359825ef941.jpg)

Once the operation is confirmed, DeployPRO will analyze the input and update the repository with all the necessary scripts for the LIVE deployment.

<br />

### Access the APP (browser)

At this point, the Django App should be fully deployed on AWS, with an active CI/CD flow:

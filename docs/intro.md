Introducing [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/): **The Simplified Cloud Application Deployment Solution**. **DeployPRO** is a service that aims to simplify the deployment process, 
empowering businesses to deploy, monitor, and scale applications without the burden of infrastructure complexities. 

Works with all major cloud providers like **[AWS](aws/)**, **[Azure](azure/)**, **[App Platform](app-platform-do/)** (DO), and **GCP** (soon). 

With [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/), you can effortlessly create and manage applications, gaining full control of your development process. 
Experience the power and flexibility of **DeployPRO** as it leads you to streamlined and hassle-free cloud deployment.

## ‚úÖ How it Works 

Once the users are authenticated with their GitHub account, the first step is to connect at least one Cloud Provider. 

With one of **[AWS](aws/)**, **[Azure](azure/)**, or **[App Platform](app-platform-do/)** activated, the users are able to create VPS servers and trigger deployments for every GitHub repository with a Dockerfile. 

The current version of `DeployPRO` requires a **Dockerized** project in order to have a successful deployment, and it is also essential to mention that `only Dokerfiles are supported` ( using docker-compose.yml won't work).

In summary, here are the benefits using **DeployPRO** service:

- Manage the VPS servers (create, delete) on AWS, Azure, and DO
- Deploy any repository using GitHub Actions (created by DeployPRO)
- Works with Public and Private Repositories 
- SSL by CertBot 
- All deployed applications are enhanced with active CI/CD flows 

<br />

## ‚úÖ Full Sample for AWS

In this demonstration, we will use an open-source sample generated by **Rocket Generator**, a free service that [Generates Django Starters](https://app-generator.dev/).

> [Django Soft Dashboard](https://github.com/app-generator/sample-rocket-django-aws) - `open-source` starter

Here are all the steps to deploy a Django Project   

- Access [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/) and register using `GitHub`
- Connect your **AWS** account using account credentials 
- Create a new VPS Server and wait the full deployment (usually takes = 5min)
- Fork this sample and create a new APP
  - https://github.com/app-generator/sample-rocket-django-aws
- Complete the deployment form
  - NOTE: Needs to have a `Dokerfile` inside
- Confirm the deployment 
- Access the GitHub repository and monitor the progress (GitHub Actions)
- Visit the app in the browser. 

At this point, the app is Deployed LIVE using a new DeployPRO subdomain, but the users can attach a domain.  

<br />

### Access [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/)

The service allows the registration using GitHub (no password required)

![DeployPRO - Registration Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51854817/263670395-cf095113-c0b1-44ab-91ef-1ca4fc871ead.jpg)
 
<br />

### Connect AWS 

In the `connections` page, users can connect to AWS via credentials. 

![DeployPRO - AWS Credentials](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51854817/263670354-2b1dd20b-4874-49f7-a97a-44f8703bb27d.jpg)

If the operation is successfull, the connection to AWS is flagged as active.

<br />

### Create new Server 

Before deploying the project, a deployment server needs to be created (operation usually takes ~5 min).

<br />

Once created, we can access the default page and also check out the details in our AWS account:

<br />

The server state can be also checked on DeployPRO.

### [Deploy Django on AWS](https://github.com/app-generator/sample-rocket-django-aws)

In this phase, the user needs to provide:

- the repository 
- app name 
- path to the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/app-generator/sample-rocket-django-aws/blob/main/Dockerfile)
- the PORT exposed in Docker (execution entry point)
  - For this project the is `PORT=5005`
- the `DeployPRO` subdomain

Once the operation is confirmed, DeployPRO will analyze the input and update the repository with all the necessary scripts for the LIVE deployment.

<br />

### Access the APP (browser)

At this point, the Django App should be fully deployed on AWS, with an active CI/CD flow:

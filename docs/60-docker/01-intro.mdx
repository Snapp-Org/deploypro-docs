# Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications in containers.
Containers are lightweight and portable units that package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments. 

> Here's a basic overview to get you started:

## Installation

First, you need to install Docker on your machine. You can find installation instructions for various operating systems on the Docker website.

<br />

## Docker Images

Docker images are the blueprints for containers. They contain everything needed to run an application, including code, runtime, libraries, and environment variables. 
Anyone can build new images or use existing ones from Docker Hub, a public repository of images.

- To build an image from a Dockerfile (a script that defines how an image should be created), you can use the docker build command.

- To pull an image from Docker Hub, you can use the docker pull command.

<br />

## Docker Containers:

Containers are instances of Docker images. They run in isolated environments on your host system.

- To run a container from an image, you can use the docker run command.
- You can specify various options like ports, volumes, environment variables, and more when running containers.

<br />

## Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. 
It defines the base image, environment setup, dependencies installation, and application code.

<br />

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to define the services, networks, and volumes for your application.

<br />

## Docker Volumes

Docker volumes are used to persist data outside of containers. They allow data to be shared between containers or stored on the host system.

<br />

## Networking

Docker Registry is a place to store and distribute Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry, but you can also set up your private registry for your organization.

<br />

## Docker Commands

Here are some essential Docker commands:

- `docker ps`: List running containers.
- `docker images`: List available images.
- `docker build`: Build an image from a Dockerfile.
- `docker run`: Run a container from an image.
- `docker-compose`: Manage multi-container applications.

<br />

Besides the above, Docker is a vast topic with many advanced features. 
Might be a good idea for a beginner to start with the basics and gradually explore more advanced concepts once the fundamentals are assimilated.

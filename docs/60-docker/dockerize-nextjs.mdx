# Dockerize NextJS

This page explains **how to Dockerize a simple NextJS** project. 

Dockerizing a Next.js application is quite similar to Dockerizing a Node.js application, with a few additional steps to consider due to Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities. 

Here's how you can Dockerize a Next.js application:

**1. Install Docker:**
Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker Desktop for Windows or Mac, or install Docker Engine on Linux.

**2. Create a Dockerfile:**
Create a file named `Dockerfile` in your Next.js project directory. This file will contain instructions for building your Docker image.

Here's an example of a `Dockerfile` for a Next.js application:

```bash
# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json files to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Build the Next.js application
RUN npm run build

# Specify the command to run the application in production mode
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

**3. Build the Docker Image:**
Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t nextjs-app .
```

Here, `nextjs-app` is the name you're giving to your Docker image, and `.` indicates the current directory as the build context.

**4. Run the Docker Container:**
After building the image, you can run a container from it using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 nextjs-app
```

Here, `-p 3000:3000` maps port 3000 from your host machine to port 3000 inside the container.

**5. Access Your Next.js App:**
Your Next.js app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

**Additional Tips:**

- If your Next.js app requires environment variables, you can pass them to the Docker container using the `-e` flag when running the `docker run` command.
- Make sure that your `package.json` contains a valid `start` script that launches your Next.js application.
- If you're working with a full-stack application or if your Next.js app interacts with other services, consider using Docker Compose to manage multiple services together.

Dockerizing your Next.js application allows you to package your app and its dependencies together, making it easier to deploy and manage across different environments.

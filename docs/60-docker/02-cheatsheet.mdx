# Docker Cheat Sheet

A Docker cheat sheet can be a handy reference while learning and working with Docker. 
Here's a comprehensive Docker cheat sheet covering the basic commands and concepts:

## Images and Containers

- **docker pull [image_name:tag]**: Pull an image from Docker Hub.
- **docker build -t [image_name:tag] [path_to_Dockerfile]**: Build an image from a Dockerfile.
- **docker images**: List all available images.
- **docker rmi [image_id]**: Remove an image.
- **docker run [options] [image_name:tag]**: Run a container from an image.
  - `-d`: Run in detached mode (in the background).
  - `-p [host_port]:[container_port]`: Map ports between host and container.
  - `--name [container_name]`: Specify a name for the container.
  - `-e [env_variable=value]`: Set environment variables.
  - `-v [host_path]:[container_path]`: Mount volumes between host and container.
  - `--rm`: Remove the container when it stops.
- **docker ps**: List running containers.
  - `-a`: List all containers (including stopped ones).
- **docker stop [container_name/ID]**: Stop a running container.
- **docker start [container_name/ID]**: Start a stopped container.
- **docker restart [container_name/ID]**: Restart a container.

<br />

## Docker Compose

- **docker-compose up**: Create and start containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
  - `-d`: Run in detached mode.
- **docker-compose down**: Stop and remove containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
- **docker-compose logs [container_name]**: View logs of a specific container.
- **docker-compose exec [container_name] [command]**: Execute a command in a running container.

<br />

## Docker Volumes

- **docker volume create [volume_name]**: Create a named volume.
- **docker volume ls**: List all volumes.
- **docker volume inspect [volume_name]**: Display detailed information about a volume.
- **docker run -v [volume_name]:[container_path]**: Mount a volume to a container.

<br />

## Networking

- **docker network create [network_name]**: Create a custom network.
- **docker network ls**: List all networks.
- **docker network inspect [network_name]**: Display detailed information about a network.
- **docker run --network [network_name] [image_name:tag]**: Run a container in a specific network.

<br />

## Other Commands

- **docker ps -aq**: List IDs of all containers (running and stopped).
- **docker rm [container_name/ID]**: Remove a stopped container.
- **docker system prune**: Remove all stopped containers, unused networks, and dangling images.

<br />

As you get more comfortable, you can delve into more advanced topics such as Dockerfile best practices, 
multi-stage builds, Docker Swarm for orchestration, and Kubernetes for container management.

<br />

## Multi-Stage Builds

Multi-stage builds are a Docker feature that allows you to create smaller, more efficient Docker images by using multiple build stages within a single Dockerfile. 
Each build stage can have its own base image and set of instructions, and only the necessary artifacts are carried forward to the next stage.

> **Benefits**

- `Smaller Images`: Unnecessary build dependencies and intermediate files are discarded, resulting in smaller final images.
- `Improved Security`: Only the necessary components are included, reducing potential attack vectors.
- `Simpler Build Process`: Developers can bundle various steps (compilation, testing, etc.) into a single Dockerfile.
- `Faster Builds`: The build process can be more efficient due to fewer layers and smaller context.

<br />

> **Example**

```bash
# Stage 1: Build application
FROM node:14 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production image
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

In this example, the first stage builds the application using Node.js, while the second stage uses a minimal Nginx image to serve the built files. 
The `--from=build` instruction copies files from the first stage into the second stage without carrying over unnecessary build artifacts.

## Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm is a native orchestration and clustering solution for Docker. It allows you to create and manage a cluster of Docker nodes, turning them into a single virtual Docker engine. 
Docker Swarm enables you to deploy and manage containers across multiple nodes, providing high availability and scalability.

> **Key Concepts**

- `Node`: A physical or virtual machine in the Docker Swarm cluster.
- `Service`: A definition of a desired state for a containerized application, specifying which image to use, how many replicas to run, and more.
- `Task`: An instance of a service running on a node.
- `Stack`: A collection of services that make up an application, defined using a Compose file.
- `Manager Node`: Controls the swarm and maintains the desired state.
- `Worker Node`: Executes tasks assigned by the manager nodes.

<br />

> **Benefits**

- `High Availability`: Services can be replicated across multiple nodes for fault tolerance.
- `Scalability`: Easily scale services up or down to meet demand.
- `Service Discovery`: Built-in DNS for service discovery among containers.
- `Load Balancing`: Traffic to services is automatically load balanced.
- `Rolling Updates`: Services can be updated with minimal downtime.
- `Secrets Management`: Securely manage sensitive data like passwords and tokens.

<br />

> **Getting Started**

- `Initialize a Swarm`: Use the docker swarm init command on a manager node.
- `Deploy Services`: Define and deploy services using the docker service create command.
- `Scaling`: Scale services up or down using the docker service scale command.
- `Load Balancing`: Access services through the swarm's load balancer.

```bash
# Initialize Swarm on manager node
docker swarm init

# Deploy a service
docker service create --name web --replicas 3 -p 80:80 nginx:alpine

# Scale the service
docker service scale web=5
```

In this example, the **nginx** service is deployed with three replicas. It can be scaled to five replicas for higher availability and load distribution.

`Docker Swarm` provides a simpler and more lightweight alternative to more complex orchestration solutions like Kubernetes, making it a great choice for many use cases.

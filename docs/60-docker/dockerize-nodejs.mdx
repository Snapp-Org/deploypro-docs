# Dockerize NodeJS

This page explains **how to Dockerize a simple NodeJS** project. 

Dockerizing a Node.js application is quite a common task that helps anyone create a consistent and portable environment for Node.js projects. 

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to Dockerize a Node.js application:

**1. Install Docker:**
Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker Desktop for Windows or Mac, or install Docker Engine on Linux.

**2. Create a Dockerfile:**
Create a file named `Dockerfile` in your Node.js project directory. This file will contain instructions for building your Docker image.

Here's a basic example of a `Dockerfile` for a Node.js application:

```bash
# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Specify the command to run your Node.js app
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

**3. Build the Docker Image:**
Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t nodejs-app .
```

Here, `nodejs-app` is the name you're giving to your Docker image, and `.` indicates the current directory as the build context.

**4. Run the Docker Container:**
After building the image, you can run a container from it using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 nodejs-app
```

Here, `-p 3000:3000` maps port 3000 from your host machine to port 3000 inside the container.

**5. Access Your Node.js App:**
Your Node.js app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

**Additional Tips:**

- If your Node.js app requires environment variables, you can pass them to the Docker container using the `-e` flag when running the `docker run` command.
- If your app requires additional setup, you can include those steps in the `Dockerfile`. For example, if you need to build frontend assets, you can add the necessary build commands.
- If you're working with a full-stack application that includes a database, you might want to use Docker Compose to manage multiple services (e.g., Node.js app and database) together.

This is a basic example to get you started with Dockerizing a Node.js application. Depending on your project's complexity and specific requirements, you might need to adjust the Dockerfile and configuration accordingly.

Dockerizing your Node.js applications can provide consistency and ease of deployment across different environments.

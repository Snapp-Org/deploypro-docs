# Dockerize VueJS

This page explains **how to Dockerize VueJS**. 

Dockerizing a Vue.js application is quite similar to Dockerizing React and other frontend applications. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to Dockerize a Vue.js application:

**1. Install Docker:**
Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker Desktop for Windows or Mac, or install Docker Engine on Linux.

**2. Create a Dockerfile:**
Create a file named `Dockerfile` in your Vue.js project directory. This file will contain instructions for building your Docker image.

Here's an example of a `Dockerfile` for a Vue.js application:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json files to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Specify the command to start the Vue.js app
CMD ["npm", "run", "serve"]
```

**3. Build the Docker Image:**
Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t vue-app .
```

Here, `vue-app` is the name you're giving to your Docker image, and `.` indicates the current directory as the build context.

**4. Run the Docker Container:**
After building the image, you can run a container from it using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 vue-app
```

Here, `-p 8080:8080` maps port 8080 from your host machine to port 8080 inside the container.

**5. Access Your Vue.js App:**
Your Vue.js app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

**Additional Tips:**

- If your Vue.js app requires environment variables, you can pass them to the Docker container using the `-e` flag when running the `docker run` command.
- Make sure that your `package.json` contains a valid `serve` script that launches your Vue.js app.

Dockerizing your Vue.js application can help ensure consistent deployments and provide an isolated environment for your app's dependencies. 
It simplifies the process of sharing and deploying your Vue.js projects across different environments.

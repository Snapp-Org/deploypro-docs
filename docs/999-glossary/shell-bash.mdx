# Bash - Bourne Again Shell

Bash, short for "Bourne Again Shell," is a widely used Unix shell and command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the operating system and executing commands. 

It's the default shell for most Linux distributions and macOS systems. Bash provides users and system administrators with a way to interact with the computer's operating system using text-based commands.

## Key Features of Bash

### **Command Execution**

Bash allows users to execute commands by typing them into the terminal. It interprets the commands and initiates the appropriate actions.

### **Scripting**

Bash can be used to create scriptsâ€”sequences of commandsâ€”that can be executed as programs or to automate repetitive tasks.

### **Shell Scripting Language**

Bash is not only an interactive shell but also a scripting language. It supports variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and other programming constructs for creating more complex scripts.

### **Environmental Variables**

Bash provides a way to define and use environmental variables, which are variables that store information about the environment or system configuration.

### **Input and Output**

Bash can handle input and output using redirection (e.g., sending the output of one command as input to another) and piping (e.g., sending the output of one command as input to another using the `|` symbol).

### **Tab Completion**

ash offers tab completion, which helps users complete commands, filenames, and paths by pressing the Tab key.

### **History** 

Bash maintains a history of previously executed commands, allowing users to easily recall and reuse them.

### **Customization**

Users can customize their Bash environment by configuring aliases, setting environmental variables, and creating custom functions.

### **Control Structures**

Bash supports control structures like loops (for, while), conditionals (if-else), and case statements.

### **Script Execution**

Bash scripts are typically executed from the command line or by running them as executable files. They are commonly used for system administration tasks, automation, and other tasks.

## Bash Samples

Learning Bash scripting is a valuable skill for working with the command line in Unix-like operating systems. 
Here are ten popular and useful Bash script examples to help you get started:

### **Hello World**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

### **Variables** 

```bash
#!/bin/bash
greeting="Hello"
echo "$greeting, World!"
```

### **User Input**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "What's your name?"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

### **Conditional Statements**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
age=20
if [ "$age" -ge 18 ]; then
    echo "You are an adult."
else
    echo "You are not an adult."
fi
```

### **Loops (while loop)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $count"
    ((count++))
done
```

### **Functions**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}
greet "Alice"
```

### **File Operations** (List files in a directory)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
directory="/path/to/directory"
for file in "$directory"/*; do
    echo "$file"
done
```

### **File Operations** (Read file line by line)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
file="/path/to/file.txt"
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "$line"
done < "$file"
```

### **Command Line Arguments**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
```

These examples cover some of the fundamental concepts of Bash scripting, including variables, user input, conditionals, loops, functions, file operations, and command line arguments. 
You can use these as building blocks to create more complex Bash scripts tailored to your needs.

<br />

In summary, **Bash** is a command-line shell and scripting language that provides a powerful interface for interacting with a Unix-like operating system. 

It's widely used by both casual users and system administrators to perform various tasks, from running simple commands to creating complex automation scripts.

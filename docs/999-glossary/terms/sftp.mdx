# SFTP

SFTP stands for "SSH File Transfer Protocol" or "Secure File Transfer Protocol." It's a network protocol used for secure file transfer and management over a secure shell (SSH) connection. 
SFTP is designed to provide encrypted, authenticated file transfers, making it a more secure alternative to traditional FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which transmits data in plain text.

Here are some **key features and characteristics of SFTP**:

## **Security** 

SFTP encrypts both data and commands exchanged between the client and the server, ensuring that sensitive information, including login credentials and file contents, is secure during transit.

## **Authenticatio** 

SFTP typically uses SSH key-based authentication or username/password authentication to verify the identity of the client and the server. This adds an extra layer of security compared to plain FTP.

## **Port** 

SFTP commonly uses port 22 by default for communication, which is the same port used by SSH. This means that, by default, SFTP traffic is allowed through firewalls that permit SSH traffic.

## **Platform Independence** 

SFTP is platform-independent and can be used on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and others. This makes it a versatile choice for file transfers between different systems.

## **Command and File Operations** 

SFTP supports a range of file operations, including uploading, downloading, renaming, deleting, and listing files and directories on the remote server. Users can perform these operations from the command line or by using SFTP client software.

## **Compatibility** 

SFTP clients and servers are widely available and supported by many hosting providers and server operating systems. This makes it a convenient choice for secure file transfers.

## **Subsystem** 

SFTP can be used as a subsystem of an SSH server, meaning that you can use the same SSH server for both secure shell access and secure file transfers. This simplifies system administration and reduces the need for additional services.

## **Batch Processing** 

SFTP can be scripted or automated for batch processing of file transfers, making it suitable for scheduled or repetitive tasks.

<br />

`In summary`, SFTP is commonly used in scenarios where data security is a top priority, such as in corporate environments, web hosting, cloud computing, and remote server administration. 
Many FTP clients and server software also support SFTP, making it relatively easy to transition from traditional FTP to the more secure SFTP for file transfers.

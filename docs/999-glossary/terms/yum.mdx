# Yum (Yellowdog Updater, Modified)

`yum` (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) is a package manager used primarily in Red Hat-based Linux distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, and Fedora. 
It helps users and system administrators to install, update, and manage software packages on their systems. 

> Here are some **key points about yum**:

## **Package Management** 

`yum` is used to perform package-related operations like installing, updating, and removing software packages. 
It handles package dependencies, making it easier to maintain a system with a large number of packages.

## **Repositories** 

`yum` relies on software repositories where packages are hosted. 
These repositories can be provided by the distribution itself, third-party sources, or locally created repositories. 

Configuration files for repositories are usually located in the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory.

## **Package Installation** 

To install a package with `yum`, you typically use the `install` command, followed by the package name. For example:

```bash
$ sudo yum install package_name
```

## **Package Updates** 

To update all packages on your system, you can use the `update` command:

```bash 
$ sudo yum update
```

## **Package Removal** 

To remove a package, you use the `remove` command:

```
$ sudo yum remove package_name
```

## **Search for Packages** 

You can search for available packages using `yum search keyword`. This helps you find packages by name or description.

## **List Installed Packages** 

You can list all installed packages with `yum list installed`. This provides a comprehensive list of packages installed on your system.

## **Clean Package Cache** 

Over time, `yum` caches packages to speed up future operations. You can clean the cache with `yum clean all`.

## **Dependencies Resolution** 

`yum` automatically resolves and installs dependencies required by the packages you want to install, ensuring that your software functions correctly.

## **Replacement by DNF** 

In some newer Red Hat-based distributions, `yum` has been largely replaced by `dnf` (Dandified YUM). 
`dnf` offers similar functionality with improvements in speed and dependency resolution. It is recommended to use `dnf` on these systems.

<br />

`In summary`, **yum** is a powerful and flexible package management tool designed for Red Hat-based Linux distributions. 
It simplifies the process of installing and managing software packages, making it easier to keep your system up to date and secure.

# FTP

FTP stands for "File Transfer Protocol." It's a standard network protocol used for transferring files from one computer to another over a network, such as the internet. 
FTP was developed in the early days of the internet to facilitate the exchange of files between different computers, and it remains in use today, although there are more secure alternatives available.

Here are some **key points about FTP**:

## **File Transfer** 

FTP is primarily used for transferring files between a client (usually a user's computer) and a server (a remote computer or system). Users can upload files to the server or download files from it.

## **Authentication** 

To access an FTP server, users typically need to provide a username and password. Some servers may also support anonymous FTP, which allows users to log in without a username and password, but with limited access.

## **Two Modes** 

FTP operates in two modes: Active and Passive. Active FTP requires the server to initiate a connection back to the client for data transfer, while Passive FTP has the client initiate the data connection. Passive mode is often used in situations involving firewalls and NAT (Network Address Translation).

## **Plain Text** 

FTP sends data, including login credentials, in plain text, which makes it vulnerable to eavesdropping and interception. For this reason, it's not considered secure for transmitting sensitive information unless used within a secured network or in conjunction with other security measures like FTPS (FTP Secure) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).

## **FTP Clients** 

Users typically use FTP clients, which are software applications, to connect to FTP servers. These clients provide a user-friendly interface for uploading, downloading, and managing files on remote servers.

## **FTP Servers** 

FTP servers are software applications or services that run on remote computers and enable FTP access. They store and serve files to clients that connect to them.

## **Alternatives** 

Due to the security limitations of FTP, more secure alternatives like FTPS (FTP Secure) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) have become more popular. These protocols add encryption and authentication mechanisms to FTP for secure file transfers.

<br />

`In summary`, **FTP** is a protocol for transferring files between computers over a network. It has been widely used for many years but has some security concerns when used in its basic form. 
Many organizations and individuals opt for more secure alternatives like FTPS or SFTP for confidential and sensitive file transfers.

# Apt-Get (package management)

**apt-get** is a command-line tool for package management on Debian-based Linux distributions, including Ubuntu. 
It is used to install, update, upgrade, and remove software packages. The name `apt-get stands` for **Advanced Package Tool** and it is one of the most commonly used package management utilities on these systems.

> Here are some common `apt-get` commands

## **Update Package Lists** 

`sudo apt-get update` - This command updates the local package database, so it knows about the latest versions of packages available in the repositories.

## **Upgrade Installed Packages** 

`sudo apt-get upgrade` - This command upgrades the installed packages to their latest available versions. It doesn't install new packages or remove old ones.

## **Install a Package** 

`sudo apt-get install package_name` - Use this command to install a new package. Replace `package_name` with the name of the package you want to install.

## **Remove a Package** 

`sudo apt-get remove package_name` - This command removes a package from your system, but it leaves its configuration files intact.

## **Remove a Package and Its Configuration Files** 

`sudo apt-get purge package_name` - This command removes a package along with its configuration files.

## **Search for Packages** 

`apt-get search keyword` - This command searches for packages containing the specified keyword in their name or description.

## **Show Package Information** 

`apt-get show package_name` - This command displays detailed information about a specific package, including its description, dependencies, and version.

## **Clean Up** 

`sudo apt-get autoremove` - This command removes packages that were automatically installed as dependencies but are no longer needed by any installed package. It can help free up disk space.

## **Fix Broken Dependencies** 

`sudo apt-get -f install` - This command attempts to fix broken package dependencies.

<br/>

Please note that you typically need superuser (root) privileges to run most `apt-get` commands, so you'll often see `sudo` used before the commands to elevate your permissions.

Keep in mind that `apt-get` has been largely replaced by `apt` on more recent Debian-based systems (Ubuntu included). `apt` provides similar functionality but with a friendlier 
interface and some additional features.

# Droplet

A **Droplet** is a term used by `DigitalOcean` to refer to a virtual private server (VPS) that runs on their cloud infrastructure. 
In other words, a Droplet is a virtual machine (VM) that you can create and manage within the DigitalOcean environment.

Each Droplet is a self-contained computing instance that includes its own operating system, storage, and configuration settings. 
You can choose the operating system (such as Linux distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, or Debian) and the hardware specifications (like CPU, RAM, and storage) when creating a Droplet.

Droplets are versatile and can be used for a wide range of purposes, including hosting websites, running applications, testing software, and more. 

DigitalOcean provides a user-friendly interface to manage your Droplets, allowing you to create, delete, resize, and perform other operations on them with ease.

One of the advantages of using Droplets is that they provide you with the flexibility of a virtual server without the need to manage the underlying hardware. 
You can set up and configure your Droplet to suit your specific needs, and DigitalOcean takes care of the infrastructure maintenance and provisioning.

`In summary`, a **Droplet is a virtual server instance offered by DigitalOcean**, which you can use to deploy and run your applications, websites, or services in the cloud.

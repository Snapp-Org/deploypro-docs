# Apt vs. Yum

`apt-get` and `yum` are both package management tools used in different Linux distributions to install, update, and manage software packages. 
However, they are associated with different package management systems used by various Linux distributions. 

> Here's a comparison of `apt-get` (used with Debian and Ubuntu) and `yum` (used with Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora):

## **Package Management Systems**

- `apt-get` is used with the Debian package management system, which uses `.deb` packages.
- `yum` (or its successor `dnf`) is used with the Red Hat package management system, which uses `.rpm` packages.

## **Distributions**

- `apt-get` is primarily used in Debian-based distributions such as Debian itself and Ubuntu.
- `yum` (or `dnf`) is used in Red Hat-based distributions like Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, and Fedora.

## **Command Differences**

While the basic functionality of both tools is similar (installing, updating, and removing packages), the commands themselves differ. For example:

- To install a package with `apt-get`, you would use `sudo apt-get install package_name`.
- To install a package with `yum`, you would use `sudo yum install package_name`.

## **Package Repositories**

- `apt-get` uses repositories defined in `/etc/apt/sources.list` and `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` on Debian-based systems.
- `yum` uses repository configuration files located in `/etc/yum.repos.d/` on Red Hat-based systems.

## **Package Dependencies**

- Both package managers handle package dependencies, ensuring that required packages are installed alongside the one you want to install.

## **Distribution-Specific**

These package managers are tailored to their respective distributions and may have some differences in behavior and available 
packages due to the different package ecosystems and policies of Debian-based and Red Hat-based systems.

## **Recent Changes**

In some Red Hat-based distributions, `yum` has been replaced by `dnf` (Dandified YUM), which offers similar functionality with improvements in speed and dependency resolution.

<br />

`In summary`, the choice between `apt-get` and `yum` (or `dnf`) depends on the Linux distribution you are using. 

If you're on a Debian-based system like Ubuntu, you'll use `apt-get`. 

If you're on a Red Hat-based system like CentOS or Fedora, you'll use `yum` or `dnf`. 

These package managers help streamline software installation and management on their respective distributions.

# AWS - Connecting on [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev)

AWS can be one of your preferred cloud providers for deploying your application. You have the option to utilize this service and link it to your DeployPRO account to easily deploy your application. To set up AWS integration, you'll need to authenticate with AWS. You'll only need to do this once for your DeployPRO account.

<!-- > You can disconnect a linked AWS account if needed. -->

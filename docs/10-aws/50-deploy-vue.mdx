# Deploy VueJS on AWS 

This page explains how to **deploy VueJS on AWS** (Amazon Web Services) using `DeployPRO`. Check our VueJS sample app [here](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-vue). You may fork it for your sample!

> ðŸ‘‰ Make sure to include the **Dockerfile** in your application's GitHub repository.

<br />

## Get Started

1. In the `Application` Menu, click on `+ Create App`.
2. Fill out the form by providing the Application name and Environment Variable if needed. Here is some information you need to consider:

    > General

    - `Server` ( Select any server you have created on DeployPRO )
    - `Type`:
        - Deploy from source code ( Used for deploying any application from your GitHub Repository )
        - MySQL ( Used for creating a database for your application )
        - PostgresSQL ( Used for creating a database for your application )

    <br />

    > Detail

    - `Repo` ( Select the repository you are going to deploy )
    - `Dockerfile Path` ( Right now, DeployPRO still needs your manual input for the location of your `dockerfile` inside the repository )
    - `Container Port` ( Please manually input the port form your `dockerfile` )
    - `Domain` ( Provide any domain name for your application. We also support `Custom Domain`!)

    <br />
    
    > Environment Variable

    - Fill out `Key` and `Value` in case you need to add some variable.

<br />

3. Click on `Create Application` button and wait for the status to change to `running`. To monitor the status change, you can use the `refresh` button.

<br />

4. Once the application is successfully deployed, you can proceed to visit the domain.

<br />

5. This is an **optional step** to perform a double-check by navigating to the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository. Make sure the icon color of workflow run is `green`. This will allow you to confirm whether your application has been successfully deployed. For a detailed status update on the `build_image` and `deploy` process, directly select the workflow.

    <br />

    On your repository, you will get new module from the deployment process.

    The detailed view of your application resembles the image provided below. You have the flexibility to either make edits or option for deletion of the application.

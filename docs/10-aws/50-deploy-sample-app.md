# Deploy Smple App with AWS on [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/)

You can deploy multiple apps and install databases on the same server, but ensure that your resources are sufficient.

For the first try, let's deploy a react app using **DeployPRO** service. Bear in mind, you **must** have `Dockerfile` inside your application in the GitHub Repository.


## React App
ðŸ‘‰ Check our react sample app [here](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-react). You may fork it for your sample!

1. In the `Application` Menu, click on `+ Create App`.
2. Fill out the form by providing the Application name and Environment Variable if needed. Here is some information you need to consider:

    > General

    - `Server` ( Select any server you have created on DeployPRO )
    - `Type`:
        - Deploy from source code ( Used for deploying any application from your GitHub Repository )
        - MySQL ( Used for creating a database for your application )
        - PostgresSQL ( Used for creating a database for your application )

    > Detail

    - `Repo` ( Select the repository you are going to deploy )
    - `Dockerfile Path` ( Right now, DeployPRO still needs your manual input for the location of your `dockerfile` inside the repository )
    - `Container Port` ( Please manually input the port form your `dockerfile` )
    - `Domain` ( Provide any domain name for your application. We also support `Custom Domain`!)

    > Environment Variable

    - Fill out `Key` and `Value` in case you need to add some variable.

3. Click on `Create Application` button and wait for the status to change to `running`. To monitor the status change, you can use the `refresh` button.

<br />

4. Once the application is successfully deployed, you can proceed to visit the domain.

<br />

5. This is an **optional step** to perform a double-check by navigating to the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository. Make sure the icon color of workflow run is `green`. This will allow you to confirm whether your application has been successfully deployed. For a detailed status update on the `build_image` and `deploy` process, directly select the workflow.

    <br />

    On your repository, you will get new module from the deployment proces.

    <br />

    The detailed view of your application resembles the image provided below. You have the flexibility to either make edits or option for deletion of the application.

## Django App

1. In the `Application` Menu, click on `+ Create App`.
2. Fill out the form by providing the Application name and Environment Variable if needed. Here is some information you need to consider:

    > General

    - `Server` ( Select any server you have created on DeployPRO )
    - `Type`:
        - Deploy from source code ( Used for deploying any application from your GitHub Repository )

    > Environment Variable

    - Fill out `Key` and `Value` in case you need to add some variable.
    - Within this Django app, there's a specific key that requires your attention. It's labeled as `APP_DOMAIN`, and you'll need to list and provide its corresponding value. The value should match the domain name provided in the details mentioned before.

## How to create an access key and secret key in AWS?

`Access keys` consist of an access key ID and a secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS. For better security, AWS recommends using IAM access keys instead of AWS root account access keys. 

IAM allows you to securely control access to AWS services and resources in your AWS account. For more information about AWS Account and Access Keys, visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/

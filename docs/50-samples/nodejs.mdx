# DeployPRO - NodeJS Sample

This free sample can be used to test the deployment for a simple `NodeJS` project. 

> ðŸ‘‰ [DeployPRO NodeJS Sample](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-nodejs) - source code

<br />

## How to use it

This NextJS sample is provided with [Docker](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-nodejs/blob/main/Dockerfile) support, the only input expected by DeployPRO service. 

```bash
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /home/node
USER node
COPY --chown=node:node ./package* ./
RUN npm install
COPY --chown=node:node ./ ./
ENV NODE_ENV=development

EXPOSE 5000
CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
```

The above `Dockerfile` does the following: 

- Pull the Image for NodeJS, version 18
- Install the dependencies 
- Update the ENVIRONMENT
- Expose the port 5000
- Starts the project  

This setup can be tested in a local workstation by cloning the [sources](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-nodejs) from GitHub and type:

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

In order to have a succesfull deployment, `DeployPRO` needs to know:

- the path to the Dockerfile
  - for this sample is `./Dockerfile`
- the external port
  - for this sample is `5000` (`EXPOSE` directive)

Once the above input is provided by the user, DeployPRO should operate the deployment without issues.

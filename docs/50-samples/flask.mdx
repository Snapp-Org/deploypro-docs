# DeployPRO - Flask Sample

This free sample can be used to test the deployment for a simple `Flask` project. 

> ðŸ‘‰ [DeployPRO Flask Sample](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-flask) - source code

<br />

## How to use it

This Flask sample is provided with [Docker](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-flask/blob/main/Dockerfile) support, the only input expected by DeployPRO service. 

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./requirements.txt /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py

EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["gunicorn", "--config", "gunicorn-cfg.py", "app:app"]
```

The above `Dockerfile` does the following: 

- Pull the Image for Python, version 3.9
- Install the dependencies 
- Update the ENVIRONMENT
- Expose the port 5000
- Starts the project via `Gunicorn` WSGI Server 

This setup can be tested in a local workstation by cloning the [sources](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-flask) from GitHub and type:

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

In order to have a succesfull deployment, `DeployPRO` needs to know:

- the path to the Dockerfile
  - for this sample is `./Dockerfile`
- the external port
  - for this sample is `5000` (`EXPOSE` directive)

Once the above input is provided by the user, DeployPRO should operate the deployment without issues.

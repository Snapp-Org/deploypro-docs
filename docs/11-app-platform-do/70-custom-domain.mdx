# Setting up Custom Domain for a Project

:::info

Currently, creating a custom domain isn't possible for applications deployed using Deploypro's subdomain. To set up a custom domain, you'll need to manage your DNS settings directly with the domain registrar, not through third-party services like Cloudflare.

:::

Here are the steps to setup custom domain for a project:

## Create Server
Log in to your Deploypro account and follow the instructions to create a server. See the guide [here](https://www.docs.deploypro.dev/app-platform-do/create-server)

![create server](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-docs/assets/46531367/30527108-2dca-476c-94ae-a04ab1b4cc7d)

Make sure your server is running by clicking on the IPv4 Address and you will be shown like picture below

![success deploy](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-docs/assets/46531367/046db01e-41da-4928-b65f-2b9fffc58c8b)

## Setup DNS Management

The next step is to configure your DNS settings. Head to your domain provider's DNS management panel and add a record for your custom domain, using the IPv4 address obtained from your Deploypro server. Check out this example of how I set up my DNS for reference:

![setup dns](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-docs/assets/46531367/7f7c46fe-c1d8-4932-9c8d-d38f221f5980)

:::note

-	Hostname: This is your desired custom domain name.
-	Record Type: Choose "A (Address)" for your IPv4 address.
-	Address: Use the IPv4 address provided by your Deploypro server.

Domain provider recommendation:
- namecheap.com
- godaddy.com
- domain.com

## Check Propagation
Once you've updated your DNS settings, it's important to verify that your custom domain is active. Use a DNS propagation checker like link to DNS checker: https://www.whatsmydns.net/ to confirm activation across different locations.

If your custom domain is activated, you should see a green check mark indicating success, similar to the picture below.

## Deploy Application
Head to the Application Menu in your Deploypro account and deploy a project as usual. For this example, we'll deploy a React application (see guide here)[https://www.docs.deploypro.dev/app-platform-do/deploy-react]. Before hitting "Create Application," follow these steps:
1.	Turn on the "Custom Domain" toggle.
2.	Enter your custom domain name in the designated field. Make sure to input `https://` before your custom domain. For example, `https://locasee.com`

Once your application is deployed and shows a "running" status, head to your custom domain using your web browser to confirm it's successfully linked. You can visit [your custom domain URL] to check.

![deploy app](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-docs/assets/46531367/52840cc9-15c6-411f-8e47-4ee0538d2a59)

Here is sample application that has been deployed with the custom domain:

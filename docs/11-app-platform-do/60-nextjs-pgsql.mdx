# Setting Up a Database for a NextJS App on App Platform (DO)

This page explains how to **set up a database on DigitalOcean App Platform for a NextJS App**  using `DeployPRO`. Also, it's important to understand that you can create multiple databases within your application using either the `PostgreSQL` or `MySQL` types.

> Make sure to include the Dockerfile in your application's GitHub repository.

ðŸ‘‰  Take a look at the sample app [here](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-nextjs-pgsql). Feel free to make a copy of it for your reference.

## Get Started

1. In the `Application Menu`, click on `+ Create App`.
2. Fill out the form. Here is some information you need to consider:

    > General

    - `Name`: Provide a name for your application.
    - `Server`: Select your App Platform (DO) server.
    - `Type`: Choose `PostgresSQL` to set up a PostgreSQL Database.

    <br />

    > Database

    - `Username`: Set your username for database access.
    - `Password`: Assign a password for database access credentials.

<br />

3. Click on `Create Application` button and wait for the status to change to running. To monitor the status change, you can use the `refresh button`.

<br />

4. Once the application is successfully deployed, you can proceed to visit the domain.

5. This is an optional step to perform a double-check by navigating to the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository. Make sure the icon color of workflow run is `green`. This will allow you to confirm whether your application has been successfully deployed. For a detailed status update on the `build_image` and `deploy` process, directly select the workflow.

    On your repository, you will get new module from the deployment proces.

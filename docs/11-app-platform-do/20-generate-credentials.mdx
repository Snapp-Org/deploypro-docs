# App Platform (DO) - Generate Credentials

To connect your DigitalOcean account to DeployPRO, you will need to generate a personal access token. A personal access token is a secure way to authenticate your requests to the DigitalOcean API. The steps are simple and you only need to copy one thing to connect your account to DeployPRO.

## Generate Token

Here are the steps in more detail:

1. Go to the DigitalOcean dashboard.
2. Click on the `API` tab.
3. In the `Tokens` section, click on the `Generate New Token` button.
4. In the New personal aaccess token form, enter a name for your token.
5. In the `Expiration` field, select the duration of the token.
6. Click on the `Generate Token button`.

This picture below is how it looks when the `Token` is created completely.

7. Do not forget to save the token by copying it. It is only shown once.

Treat Token as sensitive information. Avoid sharing them publicly or hardcoding them into your applications.

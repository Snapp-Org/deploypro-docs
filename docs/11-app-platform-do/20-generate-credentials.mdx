# App Platform (DO) - Generate Credentials

To connect your DigitalOcean account to DeployPRO, you will need to generate a personal access token. A personal access token is a secure way to authenticate your requests to the DigitalOcean API. The steps are simple and you only need to copy one thing to connect your account to DeployPRO.

## Generate Token

Here are the steps in more detail:

1. Go to the DigitalOcean dashboard.
2. Click on the `API` tab.
3. In the `Personal access tokens` section, click on the `Generate New Token` button.
4. In the Token Name field, enter a name for your token.
5. In the Permissions section, select the permissions that you want to grant to your token.
6. Click on the `Generate Token button`.

    This picture below is how it looks when the `Token` is created completely.

# App Platform (DO) - Connecting on [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev)

DigitalOcean can be one of your preferred cloud providers for deploying your application. You have the option to use this service and link it to your DeployPRO account to easily deploy your application. To set up DigitalOcean integration, you'll need to authenticate with DigitalOcean. You'll only need to do this once for your DeployPRO account.

<!-- > You can disconnect a linked DigitalOcean account if needed. -->

# Podman & React

This page explains **how to add Podman to React**. 

Here's how you can add Podman to a React application and containerize it:

**1. Install Podman:**
Before you begin, make sure you have Podman installed on your machine. You can usually install it using your operating system's package manager or by following instructions from the official Podman website.

**2. Create a React Starter Project:**
Create a basic React project with your desired directory structure, components, and your React application code.

**3. Create a Podman Container:**
To create a Podman container for your React app, you can use a Podman image that's compatible with Node.js. You can use the official Node.js image as a base and copy your application code into the container.

Here's an example `Podfile` for a React app using Podman:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json files to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Specify the command to start the React app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

**4. Build and Run the Podman Container:**
Once you have your `Podfile` (equivalent to a `Dockerfile`) and React project ready, you can build and run the Podman container using the following commands:

```bash
# Build the Podman container image
podman build -t react-app .

# Run the Podman container
podman run -p 3000:3000 react-app
```

Here, `-p 3000:3000` maps port 3000 from your host machine to port 3000 inside the container.

**5. Access Your React App:**
Your React app should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

**Additional Tips:**

- Just like with Docker, you can use environment variables to pass configuration settings to your Podman container using the `-e` flag.
- Podman supports similar networking and storage features as Docker, so you can manage container networking, volumes, and more.
- The commands for working with Podman are similar to Docker, but they use the `podman` keyword instead of `docker`.

Remember that while the basic concepts of working with Podman are similar to Docker, there might be some differences in specific commands and behavior. 
Be sure to consult the Podman documentation for more detailed information about using Podman effectively with your React application.

# Azure - Connecting on [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev)

Azure can be one of your preferred cloud providers for deploying your application. You have the option to use this service and link it to your DeployPRO account for straightforward application deployment. To set up Azure integration, you'll need to authenticate with Azure.

# Create Server for Azure

Once you've successfully linked your Microsoft Azure account to DeployPRO, you're ready to initiate the process of setting up a server for your application. Simply follow these instructions:

1. Open the `Server Menu`. If this is your first time connecting a cloud provider on [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/), you will found no list server. What you need to start deploying an application in DeployPRO is by clicking the `+ Create Server` button.

  <br />

2. Next, you will be directed to page so that you can create a server based on your preference. Ensure that you choose the cloud provider correctly. In this Microsoft Azure topic, select Azure and proceed to fill out the form.

  Here are some points you should consider right now:
    - We recommend you to write the server name in camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case or PascalCase.
    - Find the best practice of the specification. üëâ Scroll down for more information

3. Review your Server before you click `Create Server`.

  <br />

4. Your Server is **successfully createdüôå** when the status is running.

  <br />

    Ensure thorough confirmation by clicking on the `IPv4 Address`. Once the server creation process is accomplished, the resulting appearance will resemble the following:

## Information

1. You can deploy multiple apps and install databases on the same server, but ensure that your resources are sufficient.
2. You have the option to delete your server. However, it's important to note that any applications housed within the server will be automatically deleted as well.

## Specifications
Make sure to choose the appropriate specifications based on your application's requirements. While a server can serve multiple applications, if you're setting up a server specifically for a single application, the choice becomes less critical.

> For example Standard_B1ls (vcpu 1, memory 0.5, disks 2)

The `Standard_B1ls` virtual machine specification within Azure is tailored for tasks that demand minimal computing resources and are well-suited for lightweight applications. This configuration comprises 1 virtual CPU (vCPU), 0.5 GB of RAM, and 2 disks. It finds relevance in various scenarios including:
- Basic Web Presence
- Demonstrations and Showcases
- Learning and Experimentation

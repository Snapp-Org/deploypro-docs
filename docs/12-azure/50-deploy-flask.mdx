# Deploy Flask on Azure 

This page explains how to **deploy Flask on Azure** using `DeployPRO`. ðŸ‘‰ Check our Flask sample app [here](https://github.com/app-generator/deploypro-flask). You may fork it for your sample!

> Make sure to include the Dockerfile in your application's GitHub repository.

<br />

## Get Started

1. In the `Application Menu`, click on `+ Create App`.
2. Fill out the form by providing the Application name and Environment Variable if needed. Here is some information you need to consider:

    > General

    - `Server` ( Select any server you have created on DeployPRO )
    - `Type`:
        - Deploy from source code ( Used for deploying any application from your GitHub Repository )
        - MySQL ( Used for creating a database for your application )
        - PostgresSQL ( Used for creating a database for your application )

    <br />

    > Detail

    - `Repo` ( Select the repository you are going to deploy )
    - `Dockerfile Path` ( Right now, DeployPRO still needs your manual input for the location of your dockerfile inside the repository )
    - `Container Port` ( Please manually input the port form your dockerfile )
    - `Domain` ( Provide any domain name for your application. We also support Custom Domain!)

    <br />

    > Environment Variable

    - Fill out Key and Value in case you need to add some variable.

<br />

3. Click on `Create Application` button and wait for the status to change to running. To monitor the status change, you can use the `refresh button`.

<br />

4. Once the application is successfully deployed, you can proceed to visit the domain.

<br />

5. This is an optional step to perform a double-check by navigating to the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository. Make sure the icon color of workflow run is `green`. This will allow you to confirm whether your application has been successfully deployed. For a detailed status update on the `build_image` and `deploy` process, directly select the workflow.

    <br />

    On your repository, you will get new module from the deployment process.

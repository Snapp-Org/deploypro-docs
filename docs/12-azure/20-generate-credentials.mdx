# Azure - Generate Credentials

Azure Key Vault will generate two keys for the secret: an access key and a secret key. The access key is used to access the secret in Azure Key Vault. The secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt the secret.

You can also generate access keys and secret keys using the Azure CLI or the Azure PowerShell.

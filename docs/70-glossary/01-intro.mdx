# Glossary of Deployment Terms

## B

**Blue-Green Deployment**
    
    A deployment strategy where two environments (blue and green) are maintained, one serving as the current production environment while the other is used for testing and deployment. Switching between them reduces downtime and risk.

## C

**Continuous Integration (CI)**
    
    The practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository. CI systems automatically build and test the code changes, providing early feedback to developers.

**Continuous Delivery (CD)**    

    An extension of continuous integration that automates the deployment process to ensure that changes can be deployed reliably to production at any time.

**Continuous Deployment**

    An extension of continuous delivery where every change that passes automated tests is automatically deployed to production, without manual intervention.

**Canary Deployment**
    
    A deployment strategy where a new version of an application is gradually rolled out to a subset of users to test its stability and performance before a wider release.

**Container Orchestration**

    The management of containerized applications, including deployment, scaling, networking, and load balancing. Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are popular container orchestration platforms.

**Cluster**

    A cluster is a group of interconnected computers or servers that work together to provide a unified computing resource.

## D

**Deployment**
    
    The process of releasing and installing a new version of software or application to a production environment, making it available for users.

**DevOps**
  
    DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to improve collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. 
    The primary goal of DevOps is to streamline and accelerate the software development lifecycle while maintaining a focus on quality, reliability, and continuous improvement.

## E

**Environment Variables**
    
    Configurable values that are external to your application code and can be used to adjust behavior based on the environment the application is running in.

## F

**Failover**
    
    The automatic switching from a failed component or system to a standby or backup component to maintain service availability.

## H

**High Availability (HA)**
    
    A design approach that aims to minimize downtime and ensure continuous availability of services, often achieved through redundancy and failover mechanisms.

**Health Checks**

    Automated tests or probes that monitor the health and availability of applications, services, or infrastructure components.

## I

**Immutable Infrastructure**
    
    An approach where infrastructure (e.g., servers) is never modified after it's been provisioned. Instead, updates are made by deploying new instances and tearing down old ones.

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

    The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using code and automation tools, such as Terraform or CloudFormation.

## L

**Load Balancing**
    
    The distribution of incoming network traffic across multiple servers or instances to ensure efficient resource utilization, high availability, and better performance.

## M

**Microservices**
    
    An architectural style where an application is composed of loosely coupled, independently deployable services that communicate via APIs.

**Monolith**

    An architectural pattern where an entire application is developed and deployed as a single unit. Contrast with microservices.

## O

**Orchestration**
    
    The process of automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containers or virtual machines in a clustered environment.

## R

**Rolling Deployment**
    
    A deployment strategy where new versions of an application are gradually deployed to a subset of servers or instances, maintaining availability during the update process.

## S

**Service Discovery**
    
    The process of automatically detecting and registering services within a network, enabling other services to locate and interact with them.

## Z

**Zero Downtime Deployment**
    
    A deployment approach that aims to update an application without causing any interruption or downtime for users.

They both aim to take the complexity out of deploying web applications. Whether it's manual configuration or automated setup, they aim to get your application up and running faster.

## How are they different?
There are some important differences between Runcloud and DeployPRO.

### Focus
RunCloud takes a PHP-centric approach. Its interface and features are specifically designed for deploying and managing PHP applications. DeployPRO, on the other hand, is a multifaceted platform. It caters to a wider range of programming languages (Python, Node.js, etc.) and offers broader web application support.

### Database Management
RunCloud focuses on traditional relational databases. DeployPRO offers a wider variety of options, including document databases and lightweight solutions, giving users more flexibility depending on their application's needs.

### Security Features
DeployPRO emphasizes language-specific security features. This means the platform tailors its security measures to the programming language you're using. RunCloud offers general security features but may require additional configuration for specific languages.

### Automation
DeployPRO goes a step further by offering automated application setup. This can be a significant advantage for users who want a completely hands-off deployment process. RunCloud primarily focuses on simplified manual configuration.

## Moving Your Application from Runcloud to DeployPRO?
Unfortunately, there's no automatic way to switch from RunCloud to DeployPRO at this time. Since both are Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers, you'll need to set things up manually on DeployPRO.

The good news is that the DeployPRO support team is happy to help you migrate your application! They can guide you through the process to ensure everything moves smoothly and your data stays safe.

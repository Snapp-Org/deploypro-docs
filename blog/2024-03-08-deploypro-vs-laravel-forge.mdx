# DeployPRO vs Laravel Forge
Looking to streamline your application deployment and server management?
Let's compare Laravel Forge to DeployPRO!

<!--truncate-->

## What is Laravel Forge?
Laravel Forge is a server management and application deployment service. It's particularly helpful for Laravel applications, but it can also be used for many others, like: Symfony, Statamic, WordPress, or is just a vanilla PHP application.

Laravel Forge takes care of the complicated server setup stuff, so you don't need to have complex server configuration knowledge. It also automatically helps you to secure your application by default.

## What is DeployPRO?
DeployPRO is a platform that makes launching and managing your applications easier. It takes care of the technical behind-the-scenes stuff (infrastructure complexities) so you can focus on building great features.

DeployPRO works with popular programming languages like Python (Django/Flask), NodeJS (NextJS/React), and PHP (Laravel/CodeIgniter/WordPress), with more to come soon. It doesn't just make deployment easy, it also helps keep your applications secure. This reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities that hackers might try to exploit.

> So, you don't need to secure your application manually, because DeployPRO automatically sets up security features based on the programming language you're using. 

## How are they similar? 
Both platforms offer streamlined server management and application deployment functionalities. They handle the complexities of server setup, allowing you to focus on developing your application. 

Both platforms prioritize application security. Laravel Forge likely offers security features tailored to the specific needs of Laravel applications, while DeployPRO automatically sets up security features based on the chosen programming language.

## How are they different?
Both DeployPRO and Laravel Forge can help you launch and manage your applications, but they suit different needs. 

### Focus on Programming Languages
- **Laravel Forge**: Specializes in working with PHP, a specific programming language for building web applications.
- **DeployPRO**: Works with a wider range of popular languages, including Python, NodeJS, and PHP (which includes Laravel). This means DeployPRO can handle more types of applications.

### Database Support
- **Laravel Forge**: Suit to applications that typically rely on relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.
- **DeployPRO**: Provides more flexibility for developers working with various database types, including document databases (MongoDB) and lightweight options (SQLite) alongside relational databases.

## How do I migrate from Laravel Forge to DeployPRO?
Since both Laravel Forge and DeployPRO are Platform as a Service (PaaS), you'll currently need to manually migrate your database when switching between Laravel Forge to DeployPRO.  However, you can be assured that our dedicated support team is available to assist you with the migration process.

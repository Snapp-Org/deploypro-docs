# DeployPRO vs CloudWays
With so many cloud hosting choices available these days, it can be tough to pick the right one for your app. Two popular options are DeployPRO and CloudWays. They both make it easier to set up and manage your app in the cloud, but they're better suited for different situations.

<!--truncate-->

## What is CloudWays?
CloudWays was recently acquired by DigitalOcean. It acts as a middleman, taking care of server management on cloud platforms like DigitalOcean, Google Cloud Engine (GCE), and Amazon Web Services (AWS). This lets you focus on building and running your applications without worrying about the technical server stuff.

## What is DeployPRO?
DeployPRO is a service that simplifies deploying your application to different cloud providers.  Think of it as a one-stop shop for setting up your application in the cloud. It works with various popular cloud platforms, including:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- DigitalOcean
- Google Cloud Platform (and potentially more in the future)

DeployPRO takes care of the complex behind-the-scenes infrastructure so businesses can focus on developing their applications.

## How are they similar?
Both DeployPRO and CloudWays are cloud hosting platforms designed to make managing your application in the cloud easier. Since that, both free you to concentrate on developing your application by handling server management tasks.

## How are they different?
They have different expertise:

### Focus
CloudWays is built specifically for PHP applications on a limited range of cloud platforms (DigitalOcean, GCE, AWS), while DeployPRO offers more flexibility for various programming languages and cloud providers (AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud Platform, and potentially more).

### Database Support
CloudWays primarily focuses on MySQL databases, whereas DeployPRO supports a wider range of database options depending on your application's needs.

### Security Features
DeployPRO provides automatic security configuration based on the programming language you're using. This means you don't need to worry about manually setting up security features, and your application benefits from best practices right away. CloudWays also offers security features, but you might need to configure them more manually. While this gives you more control, it requires some technical knowledge.

## Final Thought
By considering your needs and technical expertise, you can choose the cloud hosting platform that best suits your application.

> Choose CloudWays if:

- You're using a PHP application.
- You're comfortable with some basic security configuration.

> Choose DeployPRO if:

- You need flexibility for different programming languages or cloud providers.
- You want a wider range of database options.
- You prefer automatic security configuration for a secure application from the beginning.

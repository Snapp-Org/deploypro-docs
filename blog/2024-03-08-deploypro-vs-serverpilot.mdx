# DeployPRO vs ServerPilot
For businesses running websites or applications, choosing the right managed hosting platform is crucial. Two popular options are ServerPilot and Deploy.PRO. Both offer features like simplified server management, security enhancements, and automated deployments. But which one is the better fit for you?

<!--truncate-->

## What is ServerPilot?
ServerPilot is a managed hosting platform that has a user-friendly interface and offers ease of use. In addition, it offers automated systems to install and configure all of the software you need to host WordPress or any other PHP web application.

ServerPilot also includes built-in firewalls, automatic SSL certificates, and intrusion detection to keep the websites secure.

## What is DeployPRO?
DeployPRO is a more flexible tool. It cannot only manage your server and deploy your website, but it also lets you use your own custom domain name with any programming language, not just PHP.

While DeployPRO offers more options for different website types, it also includes security features like firewalls, SSL certificates, and intrusion detection, similar to ServerPilot.

## How are they similar?
- Both make website hosting easier by managing technical tasks.
- Both offer security features to protect your website.

## How are they different?
ServerPilot and DeployPRO also have different feature based on their goal, including:

### Database Support
ServerPilot primarily focuses on MySQL databases, commonly used with PHP websites. DeployPRO offers a wider range of database options, depending on your application's needs.

### Continuos Integration/ Continuous Delivery ( CI/CD ) Support
DeployPRO integrates with CI/CD tools by default, allowing for automated deployments whenever you make changes to your code. While, CloudWays might require additional setup to integrate with CI/CD tools.

### Firewall Setup
Both DeployPRO and ServerPilot offer automated firewall configurations for basic website security. However, ServerPilot might provide more granular control over firewall settings for advanced security needs.

### Programming Language Support
ServerPilot is built specifically for PHP applications. DeployPRO supports a broader range of programming languages, including Python, NodeJS, and PHP, making it suitable for various website types.
